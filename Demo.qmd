## Description

This is a demonstration file where we can explore issues that you're having trouble with in class.

## Making Footnotes

We can make footnotes in line with text[^1]

What happens if we add a second footnote?[^2]

What happens if we want to write a longnote?[^longnote]

[^1]: Footnote text goes here.
[^2]: And here is that second footnote text.
[^longnote]: And here is some longer text that we might want to include as a note.

    Note that if we indent, it will remain part of the longnote.
